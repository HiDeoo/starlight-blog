description: Learn how to configure your blog to support multiple languages.

Starlight Blog relies on Starlight's built-in support for [internationalization](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/) to provide multilingual support for your blog with features like routing or fallback content.

See the [Starlight internationalization documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/) for more information on how to configure i18n in your Starlight website.

## Configure i18n

import { FileTree, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Steps>

1. Configure internationalization in your Starlight project by following the Starlight [“Configure i18n”](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#configure-i18n) guide.

2. Create a directory for each language in `src/content/docs/` based on your Starlight i18n configuration with a `blog/` directory inside each language directory.

   For example, the following directory structure is created for English, French, and Chinese languages with no root locale:

   <FileTree>

   - src/
     - content/
       - docs/
         - en/
           - blog/
         - fr/
           - blog/
         - zh-cn/
           - blog/

   </FileTree>

3. You can now add content files in the `blog/` directories of your language directories.
   Use the same file name to associate blog posts across languages.

</Steps>

## Fallback content

Similar to Starlight, Starlight Blog expects you to create equivalent blog posts in all your languages.
For example, if you have an `en/blog/hello.md` file, create an `hello.md` for each other language you support.
This allows Starlight and the Starlight Blog plugin to provide automatic fallback content for blog posts that have not yet been translated.

Read more about fallback content in the Starlight [“Internationalization”](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#fallback-content) guide.

## Translate the blog title

By default, the Starlight Blog plugin uses the same blog title for all languages.
To provide a different title for different languages, you can pass an object to the [`title`](/configuration/#title) option in the plugin configuration:

```diff lang=js
// astro.config.mjs
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import starlightBlog from 'starlight-blog'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      plugins: [
        starlightBlog({
-          title: 'My Blog',
+          title: {
+            en: 'My Blog',
+            fr: 'Mon Blog',
+          },
        }),
      ],
      title: 'My Docs',
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Translate the blog UI

The Starlight Blog plugin allows you to translate the default UI strings used in the blog so that your blog can be fully localized and readers can enjoy a seamless experience in their preferred language.

import LanguagesList from '../../../components/LanguagesList.astro'
import TranslationsList from '../../../components/TranslationsList.astro'

<LanguagesList startsSentence /> translated UI strings are provided out of the box.

To provide translations for additional languages you support — or override the default ones — check the [“Translate Starlight’s UI”](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#translate-starlights-ui) guide in the Starlight documentation.

These are the English defaults of the existing strings Starlight Blog ships with:

<TranslationsList />
