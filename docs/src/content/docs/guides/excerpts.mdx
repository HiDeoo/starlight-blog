## Post excerpts

Excerpts represent a short summary or preview of a blog post displayed in the blog post list, authors, and tags pages.
Multiple options are available to define excerpts in a blog post:

- Using the `excerpt` frontmatter property
- Using excerpt delimiters in the blog post content
- Falling back to the entire blog post content

## `excerpt` frontmatter property

The [`excerpt` frontmatter property](/guides/frontmatter/#excerpt) can be used to define a custom excerpt for a blog post.
Basic Markdown formatting is supported in the excerpt.

When defined, the content of the `excerpt` property will be used as the excerpt of the blog post.

```md {5}
---
// src/content/docs/blog/blog-post.md
title: My blog post
date: 2025-05-08
excerpt: A small excerpt of the blog postâ€¦
---
```

## Excerpt delimiters

Excerpts can also be defined using excerpt delimiters in the blog post content.
Any content above an excerpt delimiter should be standalone renderable content and will be used as the excerpt of the blog post.

The excerpt delimiter depends on either if the Markdown or MDX syntax is used in the blog post:

- Markdown: `<!-- excerpt -->`
- MDX: `{/* excerpt */}`

The following examples shows how to use an excerpt delimiter in a blog post:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Tabs syncKey="content-type">

<TabItem label="Markdown">

```md {13}
---
// src/content/docs/blog/blog-post.md
title: My blog post
date: 2025-05-08
---

Markdown content **included** in the blog post excerpt.

:::note
Any content after the excerpt delimiter is not included in the excerpt.
:::

<!-- excerpt -->

Markdown content **not included** in the blog post excerpt.
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="MDX">

```mdx {13}
---
// src/content/docs/blog/blog-post.mdx
title: My blog post
date: 2025-05-08
---

MDX content **included** in the blog post excerpt.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Aside>Any content after the excerpt delimiter is not included in the excerpt.</Aside>

{/* excerpt */}

MDX content **not included** in the blog post excerpt.
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Fallback

When no [`excerpt` frontmatter property](#excerpt-frontmatter-property) is defined and no [excerpt delimiters](#excerpt-delimiters) are present in a blog post, the entire blog post content will be used as the excerpt.
