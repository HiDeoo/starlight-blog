Starlight Blog exposes information about the blog posts in your project.
This guide explains how to use Starlight Blog’s data.

## What is blog data?

Starlight Blog data is an object containing the information about all the blog posts in your project.
It includes information like a list of all the blog posts, the title of each post, the date it was published, and the author.

## Using blog data

The `posts` object contains an array of all the blog posts in your project.

You can access this data from the `Astro.locals.starlightBlog` global in Astro components:

```astro title="example.astro"
---
const { posts } = Astro.locals.starlightBlog
//        ^ The list of all blog posts
---
```

This can be useful for example to create a widget that lists recent blog posts with their word count on your homepage:

import { Preview } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'
import BlogDataExample from '../../../components/BlogDataExample.astro'

<Preview>

```astro title="RecentBlogPosts.astro" "Astro.locals.starlightBlog.posts"
<ul>
  {
    Astro.locals.starlightBlog.posts.slice(0, 5).map((post) => (
      <li>
        <a href={post.href}>{post.title}</a>
        <em>({post.metrics.words.total} words)</em>
      </li>
    ))
  }
</ul>
```
