Starlight Blog exposes information about the blog posts in your project.
This guide explains how to use Starlight Blog’s data.

## What is blog data?

Starlight Blog data is an object containing the information about all the blog posts in your project.
It includes information like a list of all the blog posts, the title of each post, the date it was published, and the author.

## Using blog data

The `posts` object contains an array of all the blog posts in your project.

You can access this data from the `Astro.locals.starlightBlog` global in Astro components:

```astro title="example.astro"
---
const { posts } = Astro.locals.starlightBlog
//        ^ The list of all blog posts
---
```

This can be useful for example to create a widget that lists recent blog posts on your homepage:

import { Preview } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'
import BlogDataExample from '../../../components/BlogDataExample.astro'

<Preview>

```astro title="RecentBlogPosts.astro" "Astro.locals.starlightBlog.posts"
<ul>
  {
    Astro.locals.starlightBlog.posts.slice(0, 5).map((post) => (
      <li>
        <a href={post.href}>{post.title}</a>
      </li>
    ))
  }
</ul>
```

<Fragment slot="preview">

<BlogDataExample />

</Fragment>

## `starlightBlog`

The `starlightBlog` object has the following properties:

### `posts`

An list of all the blog posts in your project ordered by descending [publication date](/guides/frontmatter#date-required/).

Each post has the following properties:

#### `title`

The [title](/guides/frontmatter#title-required/) of the blog post.

#### `href`

**Type:** `string`

The link to the blog post.

#### `createdAt`

#### `updatedAt`

It is only defined if the [`lastUpdated`](/guides/frontmatter#lastupdated/) frontmatter field is specified and different from the [`date`](/guides/frontmatter#date-required/) frontmatter field.

#### `draft`

**Type:** `boolean`

Whether the blog post is a [draft](/guides/frontmatter/#draft).

#### `cover`

**Type:** `{ alt: string; image: ImageMetadata } | { alt: string; dark: ImageMetadata; light: ImageMetadata } | undefined`

Based on how the cover image is [defined](/guides/frontmatter#cover) in the frontmatter of the blog post, it can either be a single image or a pair of images for dark and light themes.
Images are imported and transformed into metadata, allowing you to pass it as a `src` to `<Image/>` or `getImage()`.

Check the Starlight Blog [`<Cover>` component](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-blog/blob/main/packages/starlight-blog/components/Cover.astro) to see an example of how to use the cover image or learn more about [images in content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#images-in-content-collections) in the Astro docs.

#### `entry`

```js
entry: {
  data: {
    description: string | undefined;
    // etc.
  }
}
```
